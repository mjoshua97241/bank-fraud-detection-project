### **Task for Next Session: Consolidate EDA Notebook**

**Objective:** Create the first official notebook for this project, `1.0-mjv-initial-data-exploration.ipynb`, by pulling relevant code from existing notebooks in another directory.

**Guiding Document:** [docs/eda_checklist.md](./docs/eda_checklist.md)

**Steps:**

1.  **Create the Notebook:** Create a new, empty Jupyter notebook at `bank-fraud-detection-project/notebooks/1.0-mjv-initial-data-exploration.ipynb`.

2.  **Review the Checklist:** Open `docs/eda_checklist.md` to use as a guide for the structure and content of the new notebook.

3.  **Locate Source Code:** Navigate to the directory containing your existing, messy notebooks.
    -   **Source Directory:** `[PASTE THE PATH TO YOUR OLD NOTEBOOKS HERE]`

4.  **Transfer Code Systematically:** Go through the `eda_checklist.md` phase by phase.
    -   For each item in the checklist (e.g., "Load Data", "Check for Duplicates"), find the corresponding code block in your old notebooks.
    -   Copy the relevant code and paste it into a new cell in `1.0-mjv-initial-data-exploration.ipynb`.

5.  **Organize and Document:**
    -   Use Markdown headings in the new notebook to clearly label each phase and step, matching the structure of the checklist (e.g., `## Phase 1: Basic Data Inspection`).
    -   Add comments or markdown notes as needed to explain the code and its output.

By the end of this task, we will have a clean, well-documented, and reproducible notebook for our initial data exploration that follows the project's best practices.
