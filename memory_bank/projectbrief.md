# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

*   **Project Name:** Bank Fraud Detection System
*   **Objective:** Develop a comprehensive and scalable **early detection model** for bank fraud, specifically targeting **EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) transactions**.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   Data ingestion and processing pipelines.
    *   Feature engineering for fraud detection.
    *   Machine learning models for fraud prediction.
    *   Data dictionary and documentation.
    *   (Add more specific goals as the project progresses)

## Project Scope

*   Focus on transaction-level fraud detection for the **January 2025 - May 2025 account dataset**.
    *   **Data Period Rationale:** We are specifically utilizing data from 2025 because fraud behaviors are constantly evolving. Older datasets may not accurately reflect current fraud patterns, and focusing on recent data ensures our model learns from the most relevant and up-to-date behavioral characteristics.
*   Utilize historical transaction data.
*   (Define what's in and out of scope as the project evolves)
