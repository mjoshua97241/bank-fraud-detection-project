# Product Context

## Why this project exists

This project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of fraud identification within banking operations. Traditional methods are often reactive and insufficient against evolving fraud schemes.

## Problems it solves

*   **Inefficient Fraud Detection:** Manual review processes are slow and prone to human error.
*   **Reactive Measures:** Current systems often detect fraud after significant losses have occurred.
*   **Lack of Comprehensive Insight:** Difficulty in identifying complex fraud networks and patterns across diverse transaction data.

## How it should work

The system should:
*   Ingest and process large volumes of transaction data.
*   Apply advanced analytical models to identify suspicious activities.
*   Provide intuitive visualization tools to prioritize alerts and uncover fraud networks.
*   (Add more details on desired functionality as the project progresses)

## User experience goals

*   **Accuracy:** High precision and recall in identifying fraudulent transactions.
*   **Timeliness:** Near real-time detection capabilities.
*   **Usability:** Intuitive interface for fraud analysts to investigate alerts.
*   **Scalability:** Ability to handle increasing data volumes and transaction rates.
